        Hi, 
        I am a graphic designer, creating mainly posters and novelties within organizations at the University of Waterloo.
        I have been working within MathSoc as well as DSC and Lifesaving Club.
        I'm testing the waters with character design, looking to creating unique characters for various media, including games, animations, and
        comics.
      </p>

        Feel free to browse through my portfolio and don't hesitate to reach out
        if you'd like to collaborate on a project!
